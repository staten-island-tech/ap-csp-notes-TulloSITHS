//Use var to make a variable (variable used to hold data)

//Syntax: var name = value;

//; is used to dicate where a line of code ends

//When assigning a word or a string to a variable you need to add quotes

//Make sure to use a // to comment to the code

//It is important to write yourself and others notes in your code so its clear what's going on

//You can later change the value of variable or even do mathematical equations in the code

//(ex: life = life - 10; life = life + 10; life = life / 10; life = life * 10)

//Booleans are variables that only have a value of true or false

//Booleans are useful especially in making if statements, if else statements, esc.

//Null is used to state that a variable does not have a value

//const is a constant variable, it cannot be modified or changed in the code later on

//It also cannot be redeclared

//let however lets you constant the value of the variable unlike const
